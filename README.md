# Node.js Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Node.js learning projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Node.js projects I worked on during my learning journey. Each project is a separate folder in this repository, and you can explore them to see what I've learned and accomplished.

## Projects

### Project 1: [QR code generator]
- **Description**: This Node.js project prompts users to input a website URL, then generates a QR code image representing the URL and saves it as 'qr.png'. It also stores the URL in a text file named 'URL.txt.'

### Project 2: [Sun Safe Tracker]
- **Description**: This project is designed to provide users with real-time information about the UV (Ultraviolet) ray index in their current location. Users can input their latitude and longitude coordinates through a simple web form. Upon submission, the system retrieves the UV index data from an external source, such as the OpenUV API. The retrieved UV index is then displayed on the web page, along with corresponding safety recommendations tailored to the UV index level.
- **Technologies Used**: Node.js, Express.js, ejs, Axios.

### Project 3: [Joke API Express Server]
- **Description**: This project is a simple Express.js server that provides a RESTful API for managing jokes. Users can interact with the API to get random jokes, retrieve specific jokes by ID, filter jokes by type, create new jokes, update existing jokes, and delete jokes. It also includes the ability to delete all jokes with authorization using a master key.
- **Technologies Used**: Node.js, Express.js, body-parser, EJS.
